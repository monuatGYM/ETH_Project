MyToken - Simple Ethereum Token Contract for Minting and Burning Tokens

## Description

MyToken is a basic Ethereum token contract written in Solidity. This contract allows you to create and manage your own token on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes functions for minting (creating) and burning (destroying) tokens, as well as checking balances.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Knowledge of Solidity and Ethereum development for customizing and deploying the contract.
- Use of Remix IDE for Testing the Contract

### Installing

You don't need to install anything to use the contract. However, you'll need to deploy it to the Ethereum network to make it functional. You can do this using tools like Remix IDE.

### Executing Program

To interact with the contract, follow these steps:

1. Deploy the contract to the Ethereum network using Remix.
2. Once deployed, you can use REMIX IDE Deploy interface to test the functions of smart contrcat.
3. Test the Mint and The Burn Function.

Now, let's explain the key functions of the contract:

#### Mint Tokens

- **Function Name**: `mintTokens(address _address, uint256 _value)`
- **Description**: This function allows you to create (mint) new tokens and increase the total supply. It's typically used to distribute tokens to specific addresses, such as initial token holders or for various purposes.
- **Parameters**:
  - `_address`: The address to which the new tokens will be sent.
  - `_value`: The number of tokens to mint and send to the specified address.
  
  
#### Burn Tokens

- **Function Name**: `burnTokens(address _address, uint256 _value)`
- **Description**: This function allows you to destroy (burn) existing tokens, which reduces the total supply. It's typically used to remove tokens from circulation, for example, when users want to reduce their token holdings.
- **Parameters**:
  - `_address`: The address from which tokens will be burned.
  - `_value`: The number of tokens to burn from the specified address.
 

These functions enable you to manage the token supply and perform basic operations on your custom token. Always ensure that you have a sufficient balance before calling the `burnTokens` function to prevent errors.
